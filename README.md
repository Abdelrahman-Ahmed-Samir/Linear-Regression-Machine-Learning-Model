# Linear-Regression-Machine-Learning-Model

1- Assign2 File

-In this model Linear Regression model was used .
-We used USA Housing Dataset (I will leave it attached)
-It's a very simple linear regression model the only trick is the address column in the dataset because the values are not numeric, So we encoded it by using the dummies way (It make the dataset more compliacted as it make it large because all addresses are different from each other of course so you can just delete the column if you don't need it )
I kept it to say how the model gonna work and It did well so the choice is your if you want to keep it or delete it.

-We created the R^^2 score function from scratch and we compared it with the built-in function in the results and the difference was something not to mention.

-We used also the following Error Rates:

1-Mean Absolute Error(MAE)

2-Mean Squared Error(MSE)

3-Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)




2- Assign2v2.py

-In this model we generated a dataset of size (1000,4) using pandas library, Columns(A,B,C,D) , Column (D) is the output (Target) of our dataset and we want the values in this column be in a way we choose like this:
 # Y = 5X1 + 3X2 + 1.5X3 + 6   ---- > 'D' = 5*'A'+3*'B'+1.5*'C'+6
 
 -Least Square Method function was created from scratch (To get the slope and y-intercept to help us predict any X we need by using this equation : Y = mX+c)
 
 -m - > Slope
 
 -y - > Y-intercept
 
 -We created the R^^2 score function from scratch and we compared it with the built-in function in the results and the difference was something not to mention.

-According to our case we have 3 inputs(features) and 1 output(target) so we will get 3 slops and 3 y-intercept to use in the equation: Y = mX+c
